"Captain Wrathbow started out as the commander of a merchant ship that "

"revenge on Wolf, Wrathbow joined the Royal Navy of Wesnoth and slowly worked "
"his way up to the rank of captain. By this time, Wolf was notorious and well-"
"known, and Wrathbow convinced his superiors to outfit him with his own ship "

"in, but unfortunately turned to piracy shortly after. He was captured by the "
"Royal Navy and imprisoned. But within the grimy stone walls of Weldyn's "
"prison, he met a necromancer who taught him all he knew about the dark arts. "
"Being younger and less feeble than the old sorcerer, Wrathbow was very "
"strong and capable in magic and soon put his new knowledge to use. He broke "
"out of the prison and fled to the north. A group of soldiers was sent to "
"pursue and finish him. They followed him into the mountains, set an ambush, "
"and attacked. He fought valiantly, but was overcome and killed. The soldiers "
"left and traveled back to Weldyn, oblivious to the lich following them. Just "
"outside the city, Wrathbow came from behind and slew them, then foolishly "
"charged into Weldyn itself, where he met his final end at the hands of the "
